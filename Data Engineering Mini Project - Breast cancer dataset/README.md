# Data Engineering Mini Project: Breast cancer dataset

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a simple data engineering pipeline using a public dataset (Breast cancer data). The goal is to ingest raw data, store it in a Oracle SQL Developer database running via Docker, transform the data with SQL and Python (Pandas), and export the results for analysis.

---

## Features
- Data ingestion: Download CSV dataset from Kaggle
- Data storage: Set up Oracle SQL Developer in Docker and load data into a table
- Data transformation: Run SQL queries and Python scripts for cleaning and aggregation
- Export: Save transformed data back to CSV for visualization or reporting

---

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x (pandas, SQLAlchemy, Jupyter Notebook)
- Docker (Oracle SQL Developer container)
- SQL (Oracle SQL Developer)
- Git & GitHub (version control)

---

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.13 installed
- Docker Desktop installed and running
- Git installed
